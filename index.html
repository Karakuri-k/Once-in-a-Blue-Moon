                Dear Detective Graves,<br>
                <br>
                I trust this letter finds you well. I regret to inform you of a most troubling matter requiring your immediate attention. <br><br>
                Last night, at approximately midnight, Franklin Carter, proprietor of the Blue Moon Jazz Club, was found dead in his private office under suspicious circumstances. His death, occurring during the club’s tenth-anniversary celebration, appears to have been caused by asphyxiation from a suspected poisoning.
                <br><br>
                Four individuals with potential motives have been detained and are being held separately to ensure their statements remain uncontaminated. The case’s sensitive nature demands discretion, and the Chief believes your expertise is essential to uncover the truth.
                <br><br>
                Please proceed to the Blue Moon Jazz Club on East 14th Street at your earliest convenience. Sergeant James Ward will provide further details upon your arrival.
                <br><br>
                As always, Stafford relies on your skill and diligence.
                <br><br>
                Yours faithfully,<br>
