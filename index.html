                Detective Graves<br>
                221B Grandview Avenue<br>
                Stafford, England<br>
                <br>
                Dear Detective Graves,<br>
                <br>
                I trust this letter finds you in good health. It is with great regret that I must inform you of a most distressing situation that demands your immediate expertise. <br>            
                <br>
                At approximately midnight last night, Mr. Franklin Carter, the esteemed proprietor of the Blue Moon Jazz Club, was found dead in his private office under circumstances that strongly suggest foul play. His death occurred during the club’s tenth-anniversary celebration, a well-attended event that has left both staff and patrons in considerable disarray. <br>
                <br>
                Initial observations indicate a sudden swelling of the throat, resulting in asphyxiation. Whilst the precise cause remains unclear, there is strong suspicion that Mr. Carter was deliberately poisoned. Four individuals of interest have been detained on the premises, each possessing potential motives for the crime. They are being held in separate rooms to ensure their statements remain untainted. <br>
                <br>
                The details of this case are murky, and the sensitive social standing of those involved requires the utmost discretion. The Chief Constable believes that your sharp eye and methodical nature are indispensable in bringing the truth to light. <br> 
                <br>
                I must therefore request that you proceed to the Blue Moon Jazz Club on East 14th Street at your earliest convenience. The officer on duty, Sergeant James Ward, will brief you further upon your arrival. <br>
                <br>
                Stafford holds you in the highest regard, Detective Graves, and places its trust in your ability to resolve this matter with the care and diligence for which you are so well known. <br>
                <br>
                Yours faithfully,<br>

                <p>"Ah, Detective Graves. How lucky we are to have you here. 
                    We’re certainly in a bit of a bind, as you can imagine. 
                    The whole department’s at a standstill, stretched thin after last week’s murder. 
                    It’s just dreadful, I tell you. But, let me get down to business and introduce you to our four main suspects, 
                    the ones you'll want to speak with shortly:
