            Detective Graves<br>
            221B Grandview Avenue<br>
            Stafford, England<br>
            <br>
            Dear Detective Graves,<br>
            <br>
            I trust this letter finds you in good health. I regret to inform you that we are faced with a most distressing situation, and your immediate expertise is urgently required. <br>
            <br>
            At approximately midnight last evening, Franklin Carter, the esteemed proprietor of the Blue Moon Jazz Club, was discovered dead in his private office under circumstances that suggest foul play. His death occurred during the clubâ€™s tenth-anniversary celebration, a highly attended event that has left the staff and patrons in disarray.<br>
            <br>
            Initial observations point to a sudden swelling of the throat, causing asphyxiation. While the exact cause remains unclear, there is strong suspicion that Mr. Carter was deliberately poisoned. Four individuals of interest have been detained on the premises, each with potential motives for the crime. They are being held in separate rooms to ensure their statements remain uncontaminated.<br>
            <br>
            The details of this case are murky, and the delicate social standing of those involved necessitates discretion. The Chief believes your keen eye and methodical approach are essential to uncovering the truth.<br>
            <br>
            Please proceed to the Blue Moon Jazz Club on East 14th Street at your earliest convenience. The officer on duty, Sergeant James Ward, will brief you further upon arrival.<br>
            <br>
            I trust you will handle this matter with the utmost care and diligence, as always. Riverwood depends on you, Detective Graves.<br>
            <br>
            Sincerely,<br>
            <b>Inspector Arthur R. Greaves</b><br>
            Stafford Police Department <br>
            Homicide Division <br>
